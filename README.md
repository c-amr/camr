CAMR: A transition-based AMR Parser
==========

CAMR is a transition-based, tree-to-graph parser for the [Abstract Meaning Representation](http://amr.isi.edu/) of a sentence. It is a product of an on-going collaboration between the [Chinese Language Processing Group](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~clp/Lab/Home.html) at Brandeis University and [`cemantix.org`](http://cemantix.org)

# Dependencies
First download the project:
      
      git clone https://github.com/Juicechuan/AMRParsing.git

Here we use a modified version of the [Stanford CoreNLP python wrapper](https://github.com/dasmith/stanford-corenlp-python), [Charniak Parser](https://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser) and [Stanford CoreNLP toolkit](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml).
To setup dependencies, run the following script:
   
      ./scripts/config.sh

>**Note:** For Mac users, there are some problems when installing the Charniak Parser python module bllipparser. We recommend to use Linux system in order to utilize the Charniak Parser. Also you may need [swig](http://www.swig.org/) to successfully install bllipparser.

# Parsing with Pre-trained Model
The input data format for parsing should be raw document with one sentence per line. 
##Preprocessing
To preprocess the data, run:
   
      python amr_parsing.py -m preprocess [input_sentence_file]

This will give you the tokenized sentences(.tok), POS tag and name entity (.prp) and dependency structure (.charniak.parse.dep) (generated by Charniak parser and Stanford Dependency converter).
Download the model trained on training set of LDC2013E117 newswire section [here](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~cwang24/LDC2013E117.train.basic-abt-charniak.m). Then use the following command to parse the sentence:

      python amr_parsing.py -m parse --model [model_file] [input_sentence_file] 2>log/error.log

This will give your the parsed AMR file(.parsed) in the same directory of your input sentence file. 
##Alignment
If you have annotated AMR file, you could first run the preprocessing step:
	
	python amr_parsing.py -m preprocess --amrfmt [input_amr_file]

This will generate a tokenized AMR file (.amr.tok) (which has :tok tag in the comments). Then you can run the following command to get the aligned AMR file(.aligned)

	./scripts/jamr_align.sh [input_amr_tok_file]


> **Note:** We use [JAMR](https://github.com/jflanigan/jamr) to get the alignment between sentence and its AMR annotation. You need to download and set up JAMR.
